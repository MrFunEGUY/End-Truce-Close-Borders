[h1]End Truce & Close Borders:[/h1]

I've had it with enemy construction ships being allowed through my territory after a war and then blobbing where they have no right to be.

I wanted to just make it so that borders wouldn't be forced open by truces, but this appears to be hardcoded. As such, this was the next best thing I could do.

[h1]About:[/h1]

Nations that you close borders to after a truce will also automatically have their borders closed to you.

The nation with whom you broke the truce will get a -150 opinion modifier with you that decays at 2 points per year.

Every nation that has contact with you and the nation that you broke the truce with will get a -25 opinion modifier with you that decays at 2 points per year.

Every time you break a truce, you will get a modifier that lowers your diplomatic weight by 15% for 15 years.
